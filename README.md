#Gender Classification on Twitter Users with SVM


##About Dataset
This data set was used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. Contributors were asked to simply view a Twitter profile and judge whether the user was a male, a female, or a brand (non-individual). The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar color.

#Inspiration

how well do words in tweets and profiles predict user gender?
what are the words that strongly predict male or female gender?
how well do stylistic factors (like link color and sidebar color) predict user gender?

#Acknowledgments
Data was provided by the Data For Everyone Library on Crowdflower.
